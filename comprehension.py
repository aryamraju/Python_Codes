# List Comprehension
# List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

# Example:

# Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.

# Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)


The Syntax
newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
